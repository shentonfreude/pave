PAVE is a resource for both supervisor and employee to accomplish the mission of various projects for one time only efforts that have a start and end date, which can last one week to 12 months. The PAVE program is sponsored by the Career Management Office (CMO). It is designed to openly solicit volunteers for high profile assignments or special projects, which may lead to greater visibility, and career enhancement for the volunteer. It is not part of the merit promotion and competitive placement plan.\r\n\r\nHow Does PAVE Work? \r\n\r\nPAVE is a web-based tool for announcing special project opportunities and selecting NASA employees for short-term and/or high visibility projects. PAVE will consist of details, temporary assignments, and other forms of special assignments on a short-term basis. As such, assignments range from brief details of a few hours to a full year. These projects will be posted weekly, or as initiated by the respective organizations. Every employee will have access to this system for viewing and applying for announcements. Volunteers must have their supervisor's approval to participate prior to applying for a project. \r\n\r\nWhat Does PAVE Offer?\r\n\r\n- Diverse ideas \r\n- Greater opportunities for individuals who may have less visibility \r\n- Occasionally will lead to opportunities for promotion (specialized experience,\r\n      visibility) \r\n- Gives potential promotion candidates \"dry run\" at assuming more responsibility \r\n- Win-win for the volunteer (applicant) and the project manager (hiring \r\n     official) \r\n\r\nOther benefits PAVE offer:\r\n\r\n- Managers get snapshots of employees during interviews.  \r\n- Managers get to observe employees\u0019 performance on the project.  \r\n- Short-term assignments benefit both managers and employees.",
