<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
  PAVE is designed to openly solicit applicants for high profile
  assignments which may lead to greater visibility and career
  enhancement for the PAVE applicant. The PAVE program enables NASA
  managers and supervisors to advertise special opportunities to NASA
  civil servants.
</p>
<p class="warning">
  Please Note PAVE is not a part of the merit promotion and competitive placement plan
</p>
<h2>What is PAVE?</h2>
<p>
  The Project Announcement Visibility Effort (PAVE) is a program that
  enables NASA managers and NASA supervisors to advertise special
  opportunities to NASA Civil Servants. These opportunities are
  details or one time only special projects that have an Objective,
  Who to Contact for questions, a Start Date, an End Date, Skill Mix
  and a Detailed Description. A NASA supervisor/manager can
  specifically target an announcement/opportunity to a specific
  audience(s) (i.e. Series, Grade, Pay Plan and/or all of NASA or
  certain Centers) through the system.
<h2>Who is Eligible?</h2>
<p>
  The PAVE communicates to NASA Civil Servants, opportunities where
  interested parties can apply on-line with minimal effort. PAVE does
  not replace Competitive Placement Plan vacancy announcements that
  require competition through merit promotion procedures.
</p>
<p>
  Employees must seek their Supervisor's approval prior to applying to
  a PAVE opportunity.
</p>
<p>
  **NASA Full-time Permanent Civil Servants only can apply
</p>
