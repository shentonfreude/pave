 Government Django Sites
=========================

Liteshia asked about other government sites that use Django.  While
it's impossible to answer definitively, I've asked on Twitter, Yammer
and other community members.

NASA Sites
==========

The public face of Science Mission Directorate operates
http://science.nasa.gov (English) and http://ciencia.nasa.gov
(Español) sites built on Django.

William Eshagh (ARC) writes that https://fragileoasis.org is Astronaut
Ron Garan's project funded by HQ (Beth Beck, Public Outreach Manager,
Mission Support and Communications Office?)

There are two big ones under https://c3.nasa.gov/ -- NASA Earth
Exchange (NEX) and DASHlink (web based collaboration tool for data mining
system health), behind the C3 portal. I found you can access it with
your NDC password, just like you use for your email, but had to use
'cshenton' instead of 'ndc\cshenton' like I do for mail.

The management interface for the NASA Nebula computing cloud system is
written in Django.

Herbert Schilling at GRC said: "About 5 years ago, I used Django for
creating a dashboard like Web app for the Webteam at GRC. It
summarizes data about our Web environment into one place, including
data from STRAW. We still use the dashboard sometimes now. Django was
a big help in getting it up and running quickly and to make it easy to
maintain."

http://code.nasa.gov is being re-implemented in Django, but is
currently a quick WordPress site.

U.S. Federal Government Sites
=============================

Someone I know through a colleague says he'll soon be deploying a
large Django application with GIS capabilities for the World Bank:
"The project aims to build a Multi-Hazard City Risk Index (MHCRI) with
the objective to help local policymakers to assess their cities’
susceptibility to climate change and other disasters’ impacts over time
and relative to other cities."

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau runs its public site on
Django: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/

Library of Congress is built on Django: http://www.loc.gov/
