==============================
 Customer Presentation Script
==============================

Not a script, really, but how we want to lay-out our points. We've
only got 20 minutes so it has to be concise.

No PowerPoint
=============

There will be now PowerPoints, just like there are no PowerPoints in
car show-rooms.

  |  PowerPoint makes us stupid.

We'll show the prototype and contrast with the status quo. Drive the
car, don't show bullet-slides about it.


Leave Behind
============

Since there's no (content-free) slides to leave behind, we'll create
some collateral that reminds and explains things.  Screen shots,
benefits, perhaps a diagram of integration with data feeds.


Idea Order
==========

Present from laptop and projector.

Status Quo PAVE
---------------

Keep this as short as possible, just a couple minutes: we're not
presenting *old* PAVE.

* Warts including multiple Welcome screens, inconsistent UI and
  policy-mandated footer, differing layout depending on function.

* Demonstrate basic functionality: recent postings, search, project
  detail page.

New Pave: demo running on laptop
--------------------------------

Here's what we've done, with a few days of prototype.  Chris needed a
sample application to show-off modern application frameworks and Steve
suggested PAVE.  Demonstrate features, test-drive:

* Attractive, modern UI
* Responsive web-design, mobile-ready at no additional cost
* Consistent layout, footer
* Same viewer functionality: recent posts, search project detail page.
* Built in 3-4 days.
* Additional capabilities easy to add due to framework.
* Documentation builds with code: consistent, encourages developers to be accurate; searchable too

Request Permission to Build a Production Version
------------------------------------------------

* Build a 1.0 version that matches existing capabilities, a measurable
  milestone
* Manage the project with Rational, using an Agile model (scrum,
  backlog, sprints)
* New features will be added in iterations after feedback from
  customers, ensuring we deliver exactly what's needed.

Agile is more appropriate then our Waterfall model, and allows us to
tailor our development to your expectations.

  |  Most engineering projects are able to actually use the waterfall design
  |  method: determine functional requirements, design, implement, test.
  |  For most software projects, this is a recipe for disaster.

Possible Issues
===============

Why not use commercial or open source off-the-shelf products?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Commercial, closed-source products would be impossible to integrate
with the data feeds that make this a uniquely-NASA application. We get
personnel qualification information from WIMS, email contacts from NED, etc.

Some commercial products will license their code, and we could extend
it to work with our data sources, but that's a large learning curve
and a non-trivial integration effort.  Updates from the vendor would
be difficult to graft back into our modified version.

Open source products might not have the licensing costs, but the
integration and maintenance work would be the same as above.

Open Source Legal Issues
------------------------

People new to Open Source worry that there may be some "intellectual
property" issues to using open source software, but this is not a
problem.  Open Source software traditionally comes with a license
explicitly defining what can and cannot be done with the software,
and the major focus is to prevent commercial interests from
profiteering from the efforts of the original developers, or
presenting the original work as the commercial company's product.

The Gnu Public License (GPL) is designed to ensure that enhancements
made to open source software get fed back into the publicly-available
code. The BSD and MIT license allow commercial companies to sell
derivative works, so long as credit is given.  None prevent
government, commercial, or non-commercial interests from *using* the
code.

Access to WIMS
--------------

We understand PAVE gets employee Center, GS level, and Job Code from
WIMS in order to target project notifications. We'll need to work with
WIMS owners to agree on access policy and set up an access method. We
do not know how long this non-technical issue will take, and it may be
out of our control.
